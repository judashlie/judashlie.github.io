Look at me, finally getting around to putting this [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) site together. It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) so I get to play with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to author my posts. 

Be patient with me. It's all about the learning.
