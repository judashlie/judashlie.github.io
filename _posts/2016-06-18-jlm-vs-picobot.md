**First, little backstory:** I've been teaching myself to code for the past couple of months. I'll probably write some posts later about some of my experiences with that. I've been focusing on learning Python, mostly because it was suggested to me by a couple of engineer friends and I find the code very readable and pleasant to look at -- I have a design background, so things like that matter to me.

On with the post...

A few weeks back I decided that I should seek out an intro-level course in computer science, to shore up some of the foundational things that I haven't thought about since the CS 101 class I took (and hated) during my sophomore year of college. So, I went to [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org) and [edX](http://www.edx.org) and started perusing the offerings. I tried the ever-popular [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) from Harvard, but it wasn't my thing  -- too much video, and a little too much thirst akin to what you typically find on reality tv. Then I hopped over to the [Stanford Computer Science 101](https://www.coursera.org/course/cs101), but it just didn't hold my attention...I also wasn't thrilled with the whole "stripped down Javascript variant" thing. I also looked at the [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-7) course from MIT. That seemed closer to what I wanted, but I still wasn't quite feeling it.

Then, I found [CS For All: Introduction to Computer Science and Python Programming](https://www.edx.org/course/cs-all-introduction-computer-science-harveymuddx-cs005x-0) from Harvey Mudd. I browsed through [the textbook](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforall/). This is what I'd been looking for -- no hour-long video lectures, a "book" I could easily reference for more information, using a language I already had some familiarity with, but more importantly actually have an interest in. I signed up and jumped into the first week's lessons.

Everything went swimmingly, eight up until I started on the final problem in the homework problem set. It was the maze on the second map of [Picobot](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/). (If you want to learn more about Picobot, you can read [this](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforall/Introduction/Introduction.html#picobot)...or go Google it for yourself.)

This was one of those moments that I've encountered a handful of times over the last couple of times where I just felt like I couldn't make any progress on the problem I was trying to solve. I tried several different approaches, outsmarted myself more than a few times, felt like tearing at my hair at least twice, left the problem behind to do something else for a little while...and finally figured out that I'd had about two-thirds of a working solution in front of me the whole time. I just had to slow myself down and very patiently step through each piece of it to figure out what I was missing. 

And even though it was a relatively simple maze, when I finally got the "Complete!" message I felt a little triumphant.
